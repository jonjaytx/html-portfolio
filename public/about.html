<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Jon, and I'm on an exciting journey as a web developer. Right
  now, I work as an implementation engineer, where I get to dive into all things
  fintech and contribute to innovative solutions. On top of that, I also do some
  freelance work as a Squarespace Web Designer, where I combine my creative side
  with my technical skills to design some awesome websites.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from my professional life, being a husband and a father is what truly
  brings me joy. My family is my biggest motivation, and they inspire me to
  improve myself every single day. I love embracing new challenges, whether
  they're personal or professional, as they help me grow.

<p>
  When I'm not knee-deep in coding projects or diapers, you can find me enjoying
  the great outdoors. I'll usually be practicing my calisthenics or running.
  There's something about being in nature that brings me balance and
  inspiration, helping me recharge and stay motivated.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for taking the time to get to know a bit about me! I'm genuinely
  excited about the future and all the opportunities that lie ahead in the world
  of web development. If you have any questions or want to collaborate, don't
  hesitate to reach out. I can't wait to connect with you!
