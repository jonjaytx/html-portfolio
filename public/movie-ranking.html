    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jon</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Emperor's New Groove</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite animated movie. I would binge this as a kid.</p>
    <h3>2. Singing In the Rain</h3>
    <p>A true classic.</p>
    <h3>3. The Menu</h3>
    <p>
      Great dark comedy thriller. Especially if you've ever worked in
      hospitality.
